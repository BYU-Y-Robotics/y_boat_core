## Getting Started with Development
### Prereqs
- Install docker on your system (follow instructions online for Windows, MacOS, or Linux)

### Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BYU-Y-Robotics/y_boat_core.git
cd y_boat_core
``` 

### Copy Secrets File
Copy the .env-example file into .env
```bash
cp .env-example .env
```
Update this .env file with the appropriate configuration for your environment

### Make the Scripts executables
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/run.sh
```

### Build and Run the Container
To test that everything is set up correctly, build and run the container with:
```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```
This opens the container and runs the ROS2 startup

For testing, run this as
```bash
./scripts/run.sh -i -p
```
The -i parameter makes it interactive, -p checks to make sure the docker image is updated and pulled correctly

Run this to test every change you make.

All packages should be created inside src/nodes/

Check out the tutorials in [ROS2 Demo] (https://github.com/byu-robotics-association/y_robotics_ros2_demo)

### Type Annotations
Every function must declare types for its arguments and return value (e.g. `def main(args: list[str] | None = None) -> None:`). CI checks this with Ruff on every PR; run the same check locally from the repo root with:
```bash
pip install ruff==0.16.5
ruff check src .github
```

#### Help with strong typed syntax
In VS Code, install the recommended extensions when prompted (or search `@recommended` in the Extensions view). Missing annotations are then underlined as you type. Hover over one and click its rule code to open Ruff's explanation with a before/after example.

```python
# Syntax for declaring types when defining a function
def int_to_string(parameter_name: int) -> str:
    return str(parameter_name)

# Syntax for declaring type on a variable
my_string: str = int_to_string(5) # This isn't necessary, and isn't enforced in the tests, but it's still helpful sometimes.
```

It's also good to understand that adding these strong type declarations do not change the behavior of the code, it simply makes the code more readable and makes development easier.

### Run Tests Before Opening a PR
Every PR runs CI checks: the type annotation check above, a build of the Docker image and workspace, and the tests for each package the PR changes. Run the same checks locally with:
```bash
./scripts/test.sh boat_perception
```
Name the package(s) you changed; packages that depend on them are tested too. Run `./scripts/test.sh` with no arguments to test everything. The first run builds the Docker image and takes a few minutes; later runs are quick. See `./scripts/test.sh -h` for options.

### Sync with Changes
The following command will sync your local environment with origin/main
```bash
git fetch
git pull origin
```

If you want to sync with a different branch run
```bash
git fetch
git pull origin/your/branch/name
```
